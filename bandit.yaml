### Bandit config file generated from:
# 'bandit-config-generator -o bandit.yaml'

### This config may optionally select a subset of tests to run or skip by
### filling out the 'tests' and 'skips' lists given below. If no tests are
### specified for inclusion then it is assumed all tests are desired. The skips
### set will remove specific tests from the include set. This can be controlled
### using the -t/-s CLI options. Note that the same test ID should not appear
### in both 'tests' and 'skips', this would be nonsensical and is detected by
### Bandit at runtime.
exlude: /build/,/out/,/libs/

# (optional) list skipped test IDs here, eg '[B101, B406]':
skips:

# Skipping B101:assert_used for test directory since pytest relies on assert statements and it's
# safe to use them in the test environment.
assert_used:
  skips: ['**/tests/**/*_test.py', '**/tests/**/test_*.py', '**/tests/*_test.py', '**/tests/test_*.py']

### (optional) plugin settings - some test plugins require configuration data
### that may be given here, per-plugin. All bandit test plugins have a built in
### set of sensible defaults and these will be used if no configuration is
### provided. It is not necessary to provide settings for every (or any) plugin
### if the defaults are acceptable.
